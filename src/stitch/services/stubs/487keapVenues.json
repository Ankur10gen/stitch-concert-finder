Her live performances are “hypnotizing, a wonder of practice and refinement” with “uncommonly tight” orchestrations (Village Voice). In her first residency show, she pairs new material with songs from her eponymous debut, combining sound, found video, and spoken word to explore the complexity of grief and the audacity of joy that are fundamental components of the Black American emotional landscape. Before the day of the show, L’Rain encourages the public to contribute to a collaborative Spotify playlist of relevant songs which will play pre and post show.

        "description": " Doors at 6PM NationalSawdust+ welcomes Ava DuVernay’s ARRAY back to the house! The dynamic grassroots collective co-presents a special evening showcasing the prodigious talents of Ghanaian-American artist Samuel “Blitz” Bazawule aka Blitz the Ambassador followed by a short Q&A with the filmmaker and National Book Award-winning author Jacqueline Woodson (Another Brooklyn, Brown Girl Dreaming). Blitz will close out the evening with a rousing hip-hop set featuring his six-piece band, the Embassy Ensemble. An essential human story of courage and survival, The Burial of Kojo chronicles the tale of two brothers through the gifted eyes of a young girl who transports the audience to the beautiful lands of Ghana and other worlds that exist between life and death. Directed by TED fellow, composer, and musician Bazawule, the film is told through a magical realist lens; it has been hailed as “an ambitious visual stunner” (Indiewire) and “an affirmation of the power of representation and a jolt in the culture of visual storytelling” (Africa is a Country). A 2019 Pan African Film Festival (PAFF) Official Selection and 2018 Urbanworld Film Festival Best Narrative Feature Winner, The Burial of Kojo marks Bazawule’s feature film debut. Founded in 2010 by filmmaker Ava DuVernay, ARRAY is a grassroots distribution, arts, and advocacy collective. Like National Sawdust, which was created to support a diversity of composers and musicians, ARRAY champions varied voices and images in cinema; it is dedicated to the amplification of independent films by people of color and female filmmakers globally. Last fall, NationalSawdust+ and ARRAY presented a screening of Akin Omotoso’s suspenseful coming-of-age drama Vaya, followed by a Q&A with Omotoso and DuVernay. NationalSawdust+, a lively performance and conversation series curated by Elena Park, brings together luminaries from across disciplines to share their passion for music and explore ideas, making surprising connections.

With three levels, three bars, balcony seating and a curved wall for optimal acoustics, the Music Hall of Williamsburg is undoubtedly one of New York&#39;s finest small live music venues. The venue plays host to both local and national acts, and over the years, has become a popular spot for both fans and performers of indie rock.</p><p>Even with the fierce competition posed by other, similar venues in the city, the Music Hall of Williamsburg continues to play host to plenty of sold-out shows. Cake, Steve Earle, Eagles of Death Metal, Nicole Atkins, Longwave, Buckcherry and Glasvegas are just a few of those featured on the Music Hall of Williamsburg schedule in the past.</p><p>There&#39;s no better time to visit. For all the latest news and up-to-date information on what&#39;s on at the Music Hall of Williamsburg, make Eventful your source, and check out the schedule right here!<p></p></p>",

After paying her dues in the highly competitive New York City jazz world, she has cultivated a vocal style that is both moving and masterfully proficient. Taking cues from Emmylou Harris and The Hot Band, she has put together a group of musicians whose technical prowess is sure to excite any audience, without resorting to cheap tricks and flashy pyrotechnics. Equally impressive as the musicians she surrounds herself with, Farrell’s original compositions truly shine. Her songwriting has been described as “the essence of folk storytelling and organic musicianship.”",
